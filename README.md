# ENGG100_Project
Project to somehow use Matlab to compute the G-Force and friction experienced by a car in a corner

## So Far
- We've assumed constant Velocity

- 2 Values of friction constants, one for regular wheels, rated at $\mu_k=0.7$, and the other for racing(soft) at $\mu_k=0.9$

We'll use the formulas: 
### Friction
$Friction \le \frac{mv^2}{r}$

### G-Force
$G-Force = \frac{acceleration(m/s^2)}{9.8 m/s^2}$

$a = \frac{V^2}{r} = v\omega = \omega^2r$

## To Do
 Functions
 1) [x] To input the data(Radius of curvature, Velocity, and Tyre Type(?))
 2) G-Force graphs
 3) Friction graphs
 4) [x] To draw said graph
 5) Animation of the vehicle on a graph/figure
