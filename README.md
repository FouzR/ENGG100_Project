# ENGG100_Project
Project to somehow use Matlab to compute the G-Force and friction experienced by a car in a corner

## So Far
-We've assumed constant Velocity

- 2 Values of friction constants, one for regular wheels(0.7), and the other for racing(soft) at 0.9

We'll use the formula
### Friction
$Friction \le \frac{m*v^2}{r}$
